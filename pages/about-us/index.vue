        <p>
          The vibrant tapestry of Latin America, with its ancient echoes and breathtaking landscapes, inspired a dream
          in
          the heart of one man, Paul Catano, our director. He visited Cusco, Perú, for a wedding and instantly fell in
          love with the city's stunning beauty and lively energy. Captivated by the chance to share his country's rich
          history with the world, he chose to stay, paving the way for a new journey. In 2013, we broadened our horizons
          by opening our first office in the United States, signaling the start of a journey to connect people around
          the
          globe with the wonders of Latin America, especially of Perú.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          <b>Gotoperu</b>, motivated by a desire to revolutionize travel in South America, began discreetly with just
          two
          committed individuals. Our objective was clear: to go beyond standard tours and provide personal, immersive
          experiences that would connect travelers with Peru's heart. As our objectives matured, we expanded our reach,
          building on Peru's success and launching <b>Gotolatam</b> in 2019 before expanding into other attractive Latin
          American
          countries. A decisive moment occurred in 2024, when we teamed up with Hidalgo, a prized colleague who shared
          our
          vision, boosting <b>GOTOGROUP's</b> goal to new levels and facilitating expansion into exciting frontiers of
          opportunity.

        <p>
          At the heart of <b>GOTOGROUP</b> lies our powerful symbol, the <b>Qente</b>. This symbol embodies our deep
          connection
          to
          Andean culture, particularly the legacy of the ancient Incas. The Qente, a mythological and formidable bird,
          represents freedom, knowledge, and protection—essential elements of the philosophy we embrace in our travels.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          In the Andean worldview, this renowned winged creature safeguards the delicate balance between nature and
          humanity. It also symbolizes our unwavering commitment to authenticity and the creation of unique, meaningful
          journeys for each visitor. The Qente signifies not only the splendor of South American landscapes but also the
          potential to grow, reach new heights, and uncover the unknown. Like this bird, we at <b>GOTOGROUP</b> aspire
          to
          elevate our customers by connecting them with the most breathtaking places in Latin America, from the ancient
          ruins of Machu Picchu to the vibrant landscapes of the Amazon jungle.

          Our logo is more than just an image; it represents our mission: to serve as guardians of an authentic travel
